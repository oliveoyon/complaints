Complaint Management System – Tables & Workflow

Core Tables:

users – existing table, stores all students, teachers, HODs, VP, principal, admin, etc. Roles managed via Spatie.

complaints – main table storing each complaint, with description, category, severity, status, assigned staff, department, anonymous flag, and timestamps.

complaint_categories – configurable categories (Academic, Facility, Behavioral, etc.).

severity_levels – configurable severity (Low, Medium, High, Urgent).

departments – stores university departments for routing/assignment.

complaint_status_histories – tracks every status change with timestamps and remarks.

complaint_feedbacks – stores student/guardian feedback and rating after resolution.

complaint_attachments – stores multiple files linked to complaints with uploader info.

complaint_slas – tracks deadlines for complaints and auto-escalation info.

Workflow:

Student/guardian raises a complaint → stored in complaints.

Complaint is categorized (category_id) and assigned severity (severity_id).

Complaint may be assigned to a department (department_id) and staff (assigned_to).

Every status change (e.g., Received → Under Consideration → Resolved) is recorded in complaint_status_histories.

Students can provide feedback after resolution → complaint_feedbacks.

Multiple files attached are stored in complaint_attachments.

SLA deadlines are tracked in complaint_slas for auto-escalation if complaints are not resolved on time.

This system uses one users table with roles for permissions; students have a different layout and route prefix, but all operations are controlled via Spatie permissions.
